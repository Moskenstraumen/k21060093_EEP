Installation required packages: Numpy, Scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn. 

Run Experiment.py and wait until 'All experiments completed successfully!' is shown on the terminal. The user will be able to view MSE improvement and learning curves for each sampling strategy in the 'Graphs' folder. 

Then run analyse_experiment.py and wait until the compilation finishes. The user will be able to view the improvement heatmap and method comparison plot in the 'experiment_analysis' folder. 

To view the analysis for the best learning curve correctly, the user is required to modify lines 199-202 of analyse_experiment.py to the corresponding best replacements for each sampling strategy obtained from Experiment.py.
